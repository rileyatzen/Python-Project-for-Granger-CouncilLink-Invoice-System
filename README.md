Analysis of Legal Outside Counsel Spend 

Objective: 
The aim of this project is to analyze the company's legal outside counsel spend from 2019 to the present, by dissecting the data to reveal key metrics such as spend by year, spend by attorney, spend by project, and spend by law firm. 

Situation: 
The company wishes to gain insights into the legal outside counsel spend that has been recorded in the “CounselLink” legal invoicing system. This analysis will enable the company to make informed decisions regarding their legal expenditures, and possibly identify areas where cost efficiencies can be achieved. 

Data Description: 
The data will be obtained from the CounselLink legal invoicing system, and then exported to Excel and uploaded into the IDAS for analysis in Python. The dataset is comprised of over 10,000 rows, which have been scrubbed for privacy purposes. The data sample we have access to is a mock version of a real company’s legal outside counsel spend that has been approved for use in this project by the company. 

Methodology: 
1. Import and clean the data: Load the data into Python and perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing. 

2. Data Analysis:  

   - Calculate the total legal outside counsel spend from 2019 to the present. 

   - Calculate the spend by year, spend by attorney, spend by project, and spend by law firm. 

3. Report: Compile a report detailing the methodology, findings, visualizations, and any recommendations. 

Expected Outcome: 
The expected outcome of this project is a comprehensive report that provides clear insights into the company's legal outside counsel spend. We hope to provide valuable recommendations for the company moving forward regarding their legal outside council spend. A breakdown of the key metrics identified is as follows:  

spend by year 

spend by attorney 

spend by project 

spend by law firm 

Constraints: 
We will need to ensure that the analysis complies with any privacy and data usage restrictions imposed by the company. Data has been scrubbed for privacy, with no real names, project names, or law firm names included.
